# Tufts CS COVID-19 Resources

*Last updated: May 18, 2020* -- added more text &amp; video resources.

If you're on this page, you are probably trying to figure out what to do this
summer. This page has some resources for you, and hopefully more to come. We
suggest you read it through and think about what you are looking to get out of
your summer.

Confused student?
-----------------

If you would like to talk to a human being about your circumstances, please
fill out [this form][confused-student]. The responses will only be visible to
select alumni, several people on the WiCS board, and Donna Cirelli.  These
people will attempt to match you with someone who has filled out the form
below.

summer?

Some specific activities...
---------------------------

Depending on what you would like to get out of your summer, zero, one,
or more of the activities listed below may be for you.


### A "Code for Good" summer software development experience

Gain valuable experience by working for a non-profit or on a personal project
under the mentorship of an upperclassman or professional in industry!

For more information, check out the
[program overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19yCL66jVhLahWVx0XvJ6kwh2qIi-VPJwHmLDOXxmDHY/edit?usp=sharing)
(alternate view [here](codeforgood)), or fill out the
[online application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdty6--eR7FvFhW5p1AgyiMe3BAQ2c-Ldjw6CPOHMhWcn4TJA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

### Your own personal or group project

What better way to spend a summer than social distancing and writing software
alone or with friends? Develop your skills further by finally making whatever
you've been dreaming of making. Maybe it's a web application, messing with an
Arduino, or a compiler for a small programming language. Whatever it is,
tinkering can help you learn a lot. Plus, you can show it off to people later.

Think about software you have always wanted to exist, or pain points in
existing software. Aim big, but start small.


Ming recommends [this very very long list](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23170881)
of Hacker News posters' current side projects. There are over 2000 responses
and multiple pages, so make sure to page through them all.


### Open source

Interested in contributing to projects such as Python and Firefox? Many
software projects are open source and very friendly to newcomers who are
interested in helping out.

Here are some resources that may be of use to you:

  have indicated that they are open to people jumping in and helping


### Research

projects spanning a variety of topics.
