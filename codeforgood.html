<p class="c1"><span class="c3 c11">Tufts CS Code for Good Summer
Program</span></p>
<em>Last updated: May 7, 2020.</em>
<p class="c1 c8"></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Overview</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Due to COVID-19, many companies
have suspended hiring and/or cancelled their summer internship
programs, leaving students without valuable opportunities to
improve their programming skills, gain real-world experience,
envision future career paths, expand their networks, and contribute
to meaningful projects. We would like to provide structure and
support for students to pursue alternative projects to achieve
these goals over the summer.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c8"></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">Projects</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">Students can decide whether they
would like to work on a personal project or a project for a client.
For those who are interested, we intend to match students,
individually or in small teams, with nonprofits, small businesses,
and other organizations in need of technical support. All students
will work approximately 20 hours per week over an 8-week period on
a project for their client, and will present their project to other
students and interested members of the CS community at the end of
the summer. We hope this will allow students to gain valuable
technical skills in areas that interest them, while building
community within the department and contributing to organizations
in need!</span></p>
<p class="c1 c8"></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c2">We expect that projects will
range in complexity: some will be reasonable for one student to
work on, others may involve small teams of students working
together, possibly with some students focused on project management
and/or design.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c8"></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c3">IF YOU ARE AWARE OF ANY
ORGANIZATIONS WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM, PLEASE</span>
<span class="c3 c10"><a class="c9" href=
"mailto:caroline_e.kaufman@tufts.edu">REACH OUT TO
CAROLINE</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
<p class="c1 c8"></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3">Alumni Involvement</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2">In order to provide the support and
mentorship students will need to succeed, we are reaching out to
the alumni community to engage with affected students in any way
they can! Here are a few key ways we hope alumni will get involved
-- but we are very open to other ideas and would love to hear from
you! Please email</span> <span class="c0"><a class="c9" href=

2020)</a></span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;with

<ul class="c12 lst-kix_e58dv9b70vg9-0 start">
<li class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Project
Coaches</span><span class="c7 c2">: Dedicated project coaches will
work with a specific student or team of students to scope out their
project and provide guidance on project management - timelines,
goal setting, MVP features, etc. Expectations are:</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="c12 lst-kix_e58dv9b70vg9-1 start">
<li class="c1 c6"><span class="c7 c2">Join initial call with client
to understand project scope and expectations</span></li>
<li class="c1 c6"><span class="c7 c2">Check in with student group
at least twice per week to set goals and evaluate
progress</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="c12 lst-kix_e58dv9b70vg9-0">
<li class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Technical
Experts</span><span class="c7 c2">: Do you have lots of experience
with a particular language, framework, or technology? We’re looking
for tech mentors to monitor dedicated Slack channels for their
chosen technologies and help students find resources and resolve
technical challenges. Examples: React, Django, Rails, Git,
etc.</span></li>
<li class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Professional
Development:</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;In addition to
supporting ongoing technical projects, we would love for alumni to
share their wisdom and experience with students! Possible ways to
help: give a Zoom presentation on your career experiences or
something you’re passionate about, review resumes at the end of the
summer, conduct mock interviews at the end of the summer, introduce
students to folks in your network who share their
interests.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c1 c8"></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2">These are just a few examples of
ways to get involved, but even if you’re not totally sure what you
might be able to commit to, we hope interested alumni will join our
Slack workspace and connect with students! If you are interested in
participating in this program in any way, please fill out</span>
